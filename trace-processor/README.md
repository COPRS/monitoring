# trace-processor

Ingest in database filtered trace

## trace-filter

### Configuration file

Application in charge of filtering trace based on one or more rules.
Rules are defined in a YAML configuration file with the following syntax:
```yaml
filters:
  -
    name: filter-1
    rules:
      task.event: begin
      output: toto
  -
    name: filter-2
    rules:
      task.event: begin|end
      header.type: REPORT
      kubernetes.pod_id: .*459c.*|d9e908c8-459c-410f-b538-18e3c442c877
```

The configuration file depict a list of filter to apply (in the above example we have two filter defined: "filter-1" and "filter-2"). 'filters' property name is mandatory and must be the first line of the configuration file. Each filter definition start with a line containing only a dash and is followed by a filter name and a 'rules' property name.

Rules section can be composed of one or more rule. Each rule is a key/value association:
- Keys are 'path' of trace structure where each level is separated by a dot. For example 'header.type' key path is associated to 'type' key of the 'header' section.
  - Values can be of three type:
    - fixed characters (i.e. compression-L0)
    - regular expression (i.e. compression-.*)
    - multiple value (i.e. compression-.*|generation) separated by a '|' character

To define regular expression please refer to [Java regex](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html). For special characters as of '.', '*' and so on you have to escape them with '\\' characters. For example to escape dot and use it as simple character use the following syntax: '\.'. List of special characters is the following:
- \
- .
- ?
- \*
- \+
- ^
- $
- [
- ]
- (
- )
- {
- }
- !
- :

The behavior of the filter is to take in the order each filter definition and find if one filter can be associated to the trace. A filter is associated to the trace if all rules can be validated. A rule is valid if the key path exists in the trace structure and if the value correspond to the one available in the trace. 
Once a filter match the trace the others are not checked. If no filter can be associated, the trace is 'sent to the trash'.

### Execution

To start the application please define the following property 'filter.path'. It indicates where configuration file is located. If property is not set or path wrong, the application won't start.

Path must be defined with the following prefix 'file:' (for example 'file:/config/filter.yaml')
